**Data Loading and Exploration:**

The code imports libraries pandas (for data manipulation) and numpy (for numerical operations).
Two CSV files, mark.csv and student.csv, are loaded into separate DataFrames named df1 and df2 respectively.
df1.info() and df2.info() display information about the DataFrames, including data types and number of columns.

**2. Data Merging:**

It's assumed both DataFrames share a common Student_id column.
pd.merge(df1, df2) combines df1 and df2 based on the Student_id column, creating a new DataFrame combined_df.
combined_df.head() displays the first few rows of the merged DataFrame.

**3. Data Quality Assessment:**

combined_df.isnull().sum() checks for missing values in the merged DataFrame. There are none in this case.
combined_df.describe() provides summary statistics for numerical columns (Student_id, Mark, Age).

**4. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**

combined_df['Employed'].value_counts() counts the occurrences of "yes" and "no" in the Employed column.
combined_df['Grade'].value_counts() counts the occurrences of each grade ("1st Class", "2nd Class", "3rd Class").
A new column, Employed, is created by converting "yes" to 1 and other values to 0 in the original Employed column. This converts the categorical data to numerical for potential future analysis.
A dictionary grade_mapping is created to map string grades ("1st Class", etc.) to numerical values (3, 2, 1).
A new column, Numeric Grade, is created by applying the grade_mapping to the Grade column. This provides a numerical representation of grades.
combined_df.describe() is called again to see the updated statistics with the new features.
combined_df['Numeric Grade'].value_counts() displays the distribution of the new Numeric Grade column.
